## Summary
Gary and Travis played in June of 2015 at Bradshaw Farms. 

He says, “My Garmin watch gives GPS on all greens. It shows yardage to the Front, Middle and Back as well as the 100 and 150 yard layups. It is a good tool for approximate distances. But the only way to be accurate is with a laser range finder.”

He mentioned the watch also gives you yardage on how far you hit the ball but did not sound like he used that feature.

“Keeping score is too much trouble so I just write it down.”

He uses the laser finder to see how far it is and then triangulates with his watch to get a better idea idea of where the pin is on the green.

If he could wave a magic wand he would want, “Chips in the flags that the GPS picks up on knows when the hole moves to give exact location.

He doesn’t have any trouble finding people to play with since joining the club and getting to know people. He plays in tournaments and special groups. And likes getting to know new people. He has plenty of friends to call and play with. But when he goes out for 18 before work, “I really don’t care who I play with and just find a group to run with.”
