# Catherine Lann Andrews

"Spoke with Catherine on Thursday evening. She had a rough day and had just gotten home from Crossfit. She has been playing since she was 9. She was raised playing. Her father was the Director of Golf at A&M. She played in college. And now plays a bunch of scramble tournaments.

She scores in the mid to upper 70s. Her career low was a 64 on July 3rd and almost cried at the end of that round she was so happy. She used to keep up with her handicap but it is difficult now without a home course. She keeps stats for putts, GIR and fairways on her scorecard.

She currently hits balls once or twice a week. She loves the range and Goldsmith is open late. Work gets in the way of getting out more often. But she usually plays twice a month at any course she can get a tee time at. She prefers playing at courses that allow singles. But a lot of times she has to find members to tag along with.

Competitive? Oh yea. But at the same time she enjoys playing with her friends that are not super good.

She learns about new gear and equipment by going to Golfsmith a lot. There are 2 within 15 minutes of her. She likes the one with the range to try out new stuff. There is a 65 year old guy named Gordon that is just great and knows his stuff. So I go and visit him. And am a little bummed when he is not there.

She used a swing resistance training aid in high school and college. She tried a golf app for a while but deleted it because it ate up all your data. She did not remember the name.

She currently keeps it old school. She finds markers and steps off yardage. She accounts for yardage, wind, spin and roll when figuring out what club to hit. Sometimes she clubs up and doesn’t take a full swing. But her distances have not changed for 6 years. The only thing that may change is if she hits a draw or fade with her woods. She always takes a couple of practice swings. And is working on just swinging not thinking.

She used SkyCaddie in college and loved it. Front, middle, back yardages. Measurements for where holes actually were on the greens. Shows flag placement for you to calculate yardage to where you want to land the ball. Also had shaded areas to help you read the greens. They were great because they were free.

Work keeps her from playing more. And traveling for work and family on weekends. But the government does not pay well enough to afford to play more.

She gets frustrated trying to find people to play with that are on the same page with why you are playing. Could be either competitive or just for fun. Hard to find females to play with. Hard to find women golfers that actually want to play and the guys get upset when you hit it by them.

Wish there were female players. I downloaded Tinder to try and find someone to play with. It was entertaining while it lasted. There are different aspects of playing that guys don’t understand. Tits get in your way. They are a pain in the ass. I have to adjust my takeaway and swing to get around them.

She feels one of the biggest problems in golf is that it is hard to learn. And expensive. Most people have to actually save up to figure out ways to play. If you don’t start when you are young its hard to pick up. Her friends miss 3 balls and then never want to come back to range again.

There are no personal messages that pop up in the GolfMatch app. She had to go through and look at everyone who’s name started with a T and tap each one. She had no idea what was going on and had to find it. And had to figure out who sent the message and go to them.

Honestly, she does not have anyone close to her age that plays regularly outside of the older men she plays with in San Marcos and San Antonio. But would love to continue the conversation."
