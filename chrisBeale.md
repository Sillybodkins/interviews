## Summary
Chris has been playing most of his life. But has gotten serious in the past few years. He is spending a lot of time on the range and playing 2 or 3 times a week at the Austin Public Links courses.

He shoots in the high 80’s and tracks his handicap. But just loves getting out and seeing the beauty of the landscape. The feel of a good shot keeps him coming back. He said, “It is hard to find a better feeling than flushing a driver 300 yards. It’s addicting.”

He is not extremely competitive but definitely compares himself to others. Pace of play frustrates him. He likes to play fast. 

He is not really looking for the latest and greatest gear. Every few years he goes to the store to see if anything catches his eye. He watches training drills on You Tube. He has used the Medicus and the Whip Trainer. And bought the Inside Approach but it is still in the box.

He regularly uses the GolfLogix app. And thinks it is pretty good but not perfect. He likes tracking his score but not putts or fairways. He wants to put the score in and be done with it. “You have to swipe to the right four times before you finish the hole.”

His biggest issue is the watch does not have a picture of the hole. The yardages and distances to hazards are great but he wants to know where the hole is going. “When I am playing with the watch I have to go back to the cart and look at my phone to see what the hole is doing until I know the course.” 

He would like to not use the phone at all. He does not want to take it to the tee box with him.

He likes that he was able to store his club ranges in the app on the phone. The app then tells him what to hit. But this information is not available on the watch. The phone gives a projection of where the shot will go based on your data.

To estimate the distance to the hole he just looks at the watch. Or uses markers if right next to one. He looks at the pin position, figures out the elevation change and considers the wind. The device gives him the baseline then he adds in the other factors. He has done a lot of range work and knows if he hits it well where it is going to go.

The big thing for front, middle and back are the wedges. The closer you get the more the range matters. “If you hit a good swing with the wrong club it is a shitty feeling. Club should give give you confidence.”

He loves the game and plays as often as able. He doesn’t have anyone his age to play with because he’s only been in town a couple of weeks and people his age all want to go to Top Golf.

If he had a magic wand there would be an Alamo Drafthouse type system where you could get beer by hitting a button. “That would be fantastic.” You only see cart girls every 4 or 5 holes. And it would be great to get food or beverages on demand.

He would love to beta test.
